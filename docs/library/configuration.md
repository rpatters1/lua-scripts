# Configuration

This library implements a UTF-8 text file scheme for configuration as follows:

- Comments start with `--`
- Leading, trailing, and extra whitespace is ignored
- Each parameter is named and delimited as follows:
`<parameter-name> = <parameter-value>`

Parameter values may be:

- Strings delimited with either single- or double-quotes
- Tables delimited with `{}` that may contain strings, booleans, or numbers
- Booleans (`true` or `false`)
- Numbers

Currently the following are not supported:

- Tables embedded within tables
- Tables containing strings that contain commas

A sample configuration file might be:

```lua
-- Configuration File for "Hairpin and Dynamic Adjustments" script
--
left_dynamic_cushion 		= 12		--evpus
right_dynamic_cushion		= -6		--evpus
```

Configuration files must be placed in a subfolder called `script_settings` within
the folder of the calling script. Each script that has a configuration file
defines its own configuration file name.

- [get_parameters](#get_parameters)

## get_parameters

```lua
configuration.get_parameters(file_name, parameter_list)
```

Searches for a file with the input filename in the `script_settings` directory and replaces the default values in `parameter_list` with any that are found in the config file.

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file_name` | `string` | the file name of the config file (which will be prepended with the `script_settings` directory) |
| `parameter_list` | `table` | a table with the parameter name as key and the default value as value |
